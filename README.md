# Project2
This application is a game to have fun.  If a user comes to the page,they need to register or log in before creating or playing with a pet.  The owners can feed, put the cat down for a nap, play with, or kill their pet. If an owner hasn't fed, played, or napped their cat in a long time the pet will die.  If the pet dies, the owner can resurrect their pet.

## Installing / Getting started

This application doesn't require any other installation for a user.

### Initial Configuration

Before starting development of this application, we needed to npm install jsonwebtoken, express-jwt, express, moment, express-handlebars, mysql2, and sequelize packages. We created the database on jawsDB and deployed to Heroku.


## Running the tests

We ran tests creating a user and creating a pet.  Made pets with all of our gifs. We fed, played, and napped a pet to make sure the bars increase.  We also killed a pet and resurrected it.  Changed our time to minutes to simulate time passing to make sure that the feed, sleep, play, and hp decreases if it has been too long.  Made sure authentication works and a user needs to be logged in before they can play with the pet.
